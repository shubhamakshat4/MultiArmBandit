Dynamic Lead Distribution using Multi Armed Bandit

simpulated_data.py is the code which generated simulated data of 100 agents for 100 days and saves it in csv named "simulated_lead_distribution.csv". An example of this file is also uploaded. 

dynamicMAB.py code takes input the agent details and distributes leads based on past performance. It does not consider lead closure matrix for the agent, however that matrix is required for comparision. Its output file is also uploaded, named "dynamic_mab_results4.csv"
